# Today-I-Learned
This is my daily learning journal.
<br>
I document what I learn every day — tech, communication, psychology, productivity, philosophy, finance, cyber security, meta learning, photography, neuro science, gaming and anything that makes me better.

## 🎯 Goals
- Build consistency
- Learn publicly
- Track my growth

## 📅 Structure
Each day has:
- What I learned
- Key insight
- Notes/resources

## 📌 Why Public?
To stay accountable and to show my journey instead of only outcomes.
